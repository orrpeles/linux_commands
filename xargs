# Create an archived test file full of png files collected recursively from machine:
find ./ -name '*.png' -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 > png.archive
Beakdown:
- find at current directory onwards png files;
- if there are whitespaces ignore them (print0)
- break them down by line (xargs -n1)
- redirect to png.archive

# you can then use pipe xargs into wc to get a breakdown for png.archive:
wc png.archive | xargs -n1

# using -I %
# ref: https://shapeshed.com/unix-xargs/

echo one two three | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo %; cd ~/backups; mkdir %'

# breakdown: \
# The -I % argument designates '%' as a variable which will be sequentially replaced by each argument encountered by xargs.
# one two three are echoes back to the terminal, each time directory is changed to ~/backups and directory is made per each call.
