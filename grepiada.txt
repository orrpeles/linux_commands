grep --include='*.py' -ilr 'glob' /home/enumtheworld/inputOutput

# goal: search for the word 'glob' in files that end with .py in the above path
#i - case sensitivity
#l - return a file
#--include='*.py' - return only files that end with .py
#4 - search recursively (the entire directory)

grep --include='*.pm' -irl 'whatsapp' / 2>/dev/null

# 2>/dev/null - throw away all the garbage

stat *.pdf | egrep -i "file:|change:" #return lines that include either 'file:' or 'change:'

tail file -n 50 | grep -E '40410|40413' # grep this and that (in this case these two error codes 40410 and 40413).
