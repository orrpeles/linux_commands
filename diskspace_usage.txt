df #dumps all file system
df -h #dumps all file system in readable format

Here is a brief explanation about the display on terminal:

Fileystem: The name of this filesystem.
1K-Blocks: The number of 1K blocks that are available on this filesystem.
Used: The number of 1K blocks that have been used on this file system.
Available: The number of 1K blocks that are unused on this file system.
Use%: The amount of space used in this file system given as a percentage.
File: The filesystem name, if specified on the command line.
Mounted on: The mount point of the filesystem.

Flags:
-B -> block size
df -BM #display all files in Megabytes
--total -> ads a bottom line total
df --total
df --total -BM #display total in megs
-T -> type of files 
df -T #provides input as to type of file
-x -> exclude specific types of files
df -x squashfs
df -x squashfs --total

df /dev/sda* #displays size of HDD
df -h --total /dev /run #display size of folders

Output and aliasing:

Let's create an alias allowing to see disk space usage. 
Parameters:

source: The name of the filesystem.
fstype: The type of the filesystem.
size: The size of the filesystem, by default in 1K blocks.
used: The space used on the filesystem, by default in 1K blocks.
avail: The available space on the filesystem, by default in 1K blocks.
pcent: The percentage of used space on the filesystem in inodes, by default in 1K blocks.
file: The filesystem name if specified on the command line.
target: The mount point for the filesystem.

alias diskSpace="df -h /dev/sda1 --output=source,fstype,size,used,avail,pcent"
Calling diskSpace will show HDD source / type / size / used / available / percentage in human readable format
